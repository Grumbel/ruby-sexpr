Ruby SExpr
==========

SExpr is a library for parsing a subset of s-expressions, namely cons
aren't handled and replaced by more convenient lists. So something
like:

  (foo (bar baz))

is parsed properly, but something like:

  (foo . (bar . (baz . ()))

isn't handled.

Right: (foo bar)
Wrong: (foo . bar)

# EOF #
